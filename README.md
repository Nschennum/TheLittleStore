# TheLittleStore

An eCommerce Web App is built on a simple NodeJS platform with the Stripe API. 
Stripe is ideal for a person or business selling just a few items because, like Paypal it is highly secure, 
but does not have a lot of the overhead charges that Paypal requires. 

The app is set up to securely take credit card payments and obtain the users shipping information.
